jlox is an tree-walk interpreter written in java for custom built language lox. both the language and interpreter are implemented in a book "[crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)" by [Bob Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/).

in this repository i re-implemnt jlox in python. the purpose of doing so is to exercise my **free will**.

> given instructions are only to use lexer for current implementation (in future all will change)

quick way to use (REPL version):

```
git clone https://github.com/itsvineet99/pylox.git
cd pylox
cd src
```

once inside `src`, type given command:

```
python lox.py
```

after typing above command you can use REPL. here you can enter correct or incorrect code in lox language and our lexer will tokenize it. 

press ctr+D to quit out of REPL version.

given is visual example:
